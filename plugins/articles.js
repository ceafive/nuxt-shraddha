    content: `A boy with a vision turned into an ambitious man with a plan. Ankit Jain is an individual set out to dominate every aspect of an industry he becomes a part of. This is the story of a vision creator. <br/> <br/>

<span class='bg-appYellow'>‘Who is Ankit Jain?’</span>

<br/><br/>

Born into a traditional family in Jodhpur, Ankit always had his path set for him. After staying out of the house for several years, working in Mumbai in the stock market hub, he was adamantly asked to come back home and take the onus of being the ‘oldest child’ in the family, the heir to the business. Being the oldest child came with certain responsibilities, however, this new kid on the block had other ideals set in place for him.

<br/> <br/>

Hungry for success, Ankit ventured into the production industry when he saw that Surat, the city he was raised in and where he went to school, had a ton of potential when it came to differing textile fashion industries. Catalogue work in Surat was brought to his attention and an idea was born.  He ventured into this seemingly unconventional stream in his family’s eyes and eventually shifted away from the stock market business. Shunned from speaking to his father for two years, he was determined to prove his family wrong, to prove to them that the line he was striving to make a name in is worthwhile.

<br/> <br/>

Gradually, change transpired and support began pouring in…Now, 6 years after its inception, Shraddha productions is a collaborative network of creators. Shraddha was born in 2014 we now sit in 2020 where they serve to portray visuals of divisions in various designs. From fusion clothing to ethnic and traditional wear to casual clothing, Shraddha Productions has some of the top-most brands in their portfolio.

<br/> <br/>

With the passion and commitment towards his baby, Ankit has pioneered Shraddha productions and guided it through overcoming various challenges, breaking records and today, it sits as the highest-paid production company in Surat. In the company of top-notch clients, Shraddha’s schedule never sits still even for a minute where 200 days out of the 365 in a year are spent travelling to exotic locations, conducting large scale projects where the output is luxury centric and up to par (of the finest quality).

<br/> <br/>

Today, after being focused and determined towards building a brand that is completely focused on the ‘deluxe’ aspect of the inner workings of this industry, Shraddha productions are ready to reach the masses with its work. Ankit has found his niche in the Surat market and is focused on increasing his level of exposure immensely.

<br/> <br/>

Portraying his work and gaining exposure in a way in which rates and other aspects are played around with, to provide incentives highlights us with the fact that they are not hungry for money. No big margins are involved as innately and foremostly, Ankit loves his work and is extremely ardent about what he is pursuing.

<br/> <br/>

Shraddha Productions does not offer work at a nominal level. For drive and impetus, they do not want to remain stagnant and want to keep the momentum going. The level of commitment and talent of his team has also been a force which has allowed Shraddha to grow into a one-stop solution for all brands- with versatile offerings. With a malleable mindset, Ankit is an individual accustomed to going with the flow of things. Being well-travelled and a graduate with a strong CA foundation, Ankit found his passion behind a lens, capturing fleeting moments and assuring the sustenance of memories.
